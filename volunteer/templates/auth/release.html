<h2 class="text-center">The Food Pantry at Central Release</h2>
    <p>This Release by <strong>{{ g.user['given_name']}} {{ g.user['family_name']}}</strong>, who is referred to below as VOLUNTEER, is on behalf of Central Presbyterian Church of Mobile ("CHURCH"), explained further and referred to below as CHURCH. The Release relates to VOLUNTEER's work for CHURCH's Food Pantry program.</p>
    <p>CHURCH in this Release means the Church as an entity and also all people connected with leadership and decision-making for the entity.</p>
    <p>VOLUNTEER understands that in working in the Food Pantry program VOLUNTEER is in no sense an employee of CHURCH. VOLUNTEER also understands that the work for the Food Pantry involves risks of physical injury, as it sometime requires volunteers to work in heat or foul weather, to work in auto traffic, to lift heavy packages, to lift boxes from a metal conveyer system, to move heavy loads up and down ramps, to pass through narrow hallways sometimes crowded with people and items on floors , and to otherwise encounter trip hazards that arise from the Food Pantry activity or from the conditions of the Church building, and to do other tasks that involve a risk of physical harm, personal injury (including serious injuries that might lead to death), and damage to or loss of personal property.</p>
    <p>VOLUNTEER's participation in the Food Pantry program is important to VOLUNTEER as a part of VOLUNTEER's personal and/or religious commitment to give assistance to those less fortunate.</p>
    <p>Understanding the risks described above, and in exchange for CHURCH's allowing VOLUNTEER to work in the Food Pantry program, VOLUNTEER hereby releases and forever discharges CHURCH (as defined above) from any and all claims and liability arising from any injury or loss VOLUNTEER may sustain while working at the Food Pantry. VOLUNTEER understands that VOLUNTEER will have no ability to be compensated in money damages from CHURCH (as defined above) and agrees to hold CHURCH harmless from such damages. VOLUNTEER SPECIFICALLY ACKOWLEDGES THAT THIS RELEASE IS DIRECTED TO CLAIMS AND INJURIES THAT HAVE NOT YET HAPPENED OR ARISEN.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">COVENANT NOT TO SUE</h2>
    <p>VOLUNTEER understands that VOLUNTEER has no claim for damages relating to VOLUNTEER's work at the Food Pantry, but also is aware that lawsuits are sometimes filed on claims that have no merit. Defending such a claim by VOLUNTEER would be very expensive to CHURCH. Therefore, VOLUNTEER agrees in addition that VOLUNTEER will not begin any lawsuit against CHURCH based on any injury or loss suffered by VOLUNTEER during work at the Food Pantry.</p>
